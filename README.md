🎉 Excited to share my latest project! 📊 Built a prediction model to classify SMS messages as spam or ham using the SMS Spam Collection dataset 📱. Trained a machine learning model achieving impressive accuracy in distinguishing between legitimate and spam messages 🤖.

This project involved data collection from various sources, including a UK forum and academic datasets 📝. Followed by preprocessing and feature extraction from the raw text of the messages 🧰. Leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, developed a robust model capable of accurately identifying spam messages 🛠️.

The results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning in spam detection but also contribute to ongoing research in SMS spam filtering 📈. Excited about the potential applications of this model in real-world scenarios to enhance communication security 🔒.
